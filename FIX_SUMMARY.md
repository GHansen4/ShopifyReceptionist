## 💡 FAQ

**Q: Did my code need to change?**
A: No! React 18 is backward compatible. All your code works as-is.

**Q: Will this affect production?**
A: No. This is a more stable, production-ready setup than React 19.

**Q: Can I use `npm run dev` instead of `npx @shopify/cli app dev`?**
A: Yes, but Shopify CLI is recommended as it handles the tunnel automatically.

**Q: When can I upgrade to React 19?**
A: Wait for @shopify/polaris to officially support React 19.

**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes. This is purely a dependency update. No data changes.

**Q: Do I need to redeploy?**
A: No, unless you're testing locally. For production, follow your normal deployment process.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Wait for npm install** to complete (2-5 minutes)
2. **Verify installation** with the commands above
3. **Test development** with `npx @shopify/cli app dev`
4. **No code changes needed** - your app works as-is
5. **Deploy normally** - nothing else needed

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

If npm install is taking too long:
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to cancel
# Then try again
npm install
```

If you see React 19 still in node_modules:
```bash
# Force a clean install
npm install --force
```

If type errors appear:
```bash
npm run clean:cache
npm run type-check
```
