# TUNNEL CLEANUP SUMMARY

## Changes Made

### 1.  Shopify Configuration (shopify.app.toml)
**Removed:** Hardcoded Cloudflare tunnel URLs
**Updated:**
- `application_url`: Changed from hardcoded `https://coupon-cricket-retro-friendly.trycloudflare.com` to `${SHOPIFY_APP_URL}` environment variable
- `redirect_urls`: Removed hardcoded tunnel URL, now uses `${SHOPIFY_APP_URL}/api/auth/callback`
- Removed obsolete localhost redirect URL

**Impact:** Configuration now dynamically adapts to the URL provided by Shopify CLI

### 2.  Environment Configuration (src/lib/env.ts)
**Changes:**
- Made `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` (from CLI) and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (manual) both optional
- Added priority logic: CLI`s SHOPIFY_APP_URL takes precedence over NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- Added `getAppUrl()` helper function for centralized URL resolution
- Both variables are now validated but only one is required

**Priority Order:**
1. `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` (Shopify CLI - primary, recommended for development)
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` (Manual configuration - fallback for production)

**Backward Compatibility:** Existing deployments using NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL still work

### 3.  OAuth Routes (src/app/api/auth/route.ts & callback/route.ts)
**Changes:**
- Updated to use centralized `env.SHOPIFY_APP_URL` instead of `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- Removed direct process.env access for URLs
- Ensures consistent URL handling across all authentication flows

### 4.  Shopify Client (src/lib/shopify/client.ts)
**Changes:**
- Updated `hostName` configuration to use `env.SHOPIFY_APP_URL`
- Ensures Shopify API is initialized with correct app URL

### 5.  Next.js Configuration (next.config.ts)
**Changes:**
- Added `SHOPIFY_APP_URL` to environment variables (with fallback to NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL)
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing deployments

### 6.  State Manager (src/lib/shopify/state-manager.ts)
**Removed:** Comment about Cloudflare tunnels and proxy-related redirects
**Updated:** Documentation to explain distributed systems support with database-backed storage

**Still Included (as it should be):** 
- In-memory OAuth state storage (needed even with Shopify CLI for reliability)
- 10-minute TTL cleanup
- 3-tier fallback system (database > memory > cookies)

### 7.  Environment Variables Documentation (.env.example)
**Created:** Comprehensive .env.example with:
- Clear distinction between CLI-provided SHOPIFY_APP_URL and manual NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
- Development workflow instructions (use Shopify CLI)
- Production workflow instructions (manual setup)
- Removed any references to manual tunnel management
- Organized by configuration section with helpful comments

### 8.  README.md Updates
**Installation Section:**
- Removed references to manual tunnel setup
- Added Shopify CLI as primary development method

**Development Section:**
- Primary: `npx @shopify/cli app dev` (recommended)
- Alternative: `npm run dev` with manual NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL

**Scripts Section:**
- Highlighted Shopify CLI as the recommended development command
- Clear distinction between CLI and manual workflows

## Removed Components

 **Hardcoded URLs**
- Removed: `https://coupon-cricket-retro-friendly.trycloudflare.com`
- Removed: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` (deprecated alternative)

 **Tunnel-Specific Documentation**
- Removed: Cloudflare tunnel references
- Removed: Proxy-related edge cases in comments
- Removed: Manual tunnel health check documentation

 **Redundant URL Configuration**
- Removed: Multiple separate URL configurations
- Consolidated: All URL handling through env.SHOPIFY_APP_URL

---

## New Development Workflow

### Before (Manual Tunnel Management)
```bash
# 1. Start ngrok/Cloudflare tunnel manually
ngrok http 3000
# or
cloudflare tunnel run my-tunnel

# 2. Manually update shopify.app.toml with tunnel URL
# 3. Update .env.local with tunnel URL
# 4. Start Next.js dev server
npm run dev

# 5. Manually manage tunnel health and reconnections
```

### After (Shopify CLI)
```bash
# Single command - everything is automatic!
npx @shopify/cli app dev

# That''s it! CLI handles:
#  Tunnel creation
#  SHOPIFY_APP_URL environment variable
#  Redirect URL configuration
#  Next.js dev server
#  Hot reload and error handling
```

## Code Quality Verification

 **Requirements.md Compliance:**
- Maintains all TR (Technical Requirements)
- Continues using environment variables with Zod validation
- No breaking changes to security posture

 **Contributing.md Compliance:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- No console errors (only development logging)
- Error handling patterns maintained
- Environment validation via Zod

 **No Linting Errors**
- All modified files pass ESLint
- Type safety maintained throughout
- No warnings introduced

---

## Migration Path for Existing Deployments

### Development Environments
**Current:** Using `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000`
**Migration:** 
```bash
# Simply use Shopify CLI instead
npx @shopify/cli app dev
# SHOPIFY_APP_URL will be set automatically
```

### Production Environments
**Current:** Using `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://my-app.example.com`
**Migration:** Optional
-  Continue using NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL (still supported)
-  Or switch to SHOPIFY_APP_URL if deployed via CLI
- No changes required unless desired
