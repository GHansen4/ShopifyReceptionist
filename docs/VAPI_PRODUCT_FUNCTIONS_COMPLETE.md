# Vapi Product Functions - Complete! ✅

Your AI receptionist can now answer questions about products in your Shopify store!

## **What Was Implemented:**

### 1. **Vapi Functions Endpoint** (`/api/vapi/functions/route.ts`)
Two functions the AI can call during phone conversations:

- **`get_products`** - Fetches a list of products from your store
  - Use case: "What do you sell?", "What products do you have?"
  - Returns: Product titles, descriptions, prices, availability
  
- **`search_products`** - Searches for specific products by keyword
  - Use case: "Do you have t-shirts?", "I'm looking for shoes"
  - Returns: Matching products with details

### 2. **Updated Assistant Configuration**
The AI now:
- ✅ Knows it has access to product data
- ✅ Knows when to call functions (product questions)
- ✅ Provides accurate, real-time information
- ✅ Gracefully handles "product not found" scenarios

### 3. **System Prompt Enhancements**
Added instructions for:
- When to fetch product data
- How to present product information
- Handling availability questions
- Offering to connect with team for complex questions

## **How to Test:**

### **Step 1: Provision New Assistant**
1. Go to `/test/vapi?shop=always-ai-dev-store.myshopify.com`
2. Click **"Provision Test Phone Number"**
3. Wait for success message
4. Your phone number: **`+1 (831) 200-2458`**

### **Step 2: Call and Ask About Products**

Try these questions:

#### **General Product Questions:**
- "What products do you sell?"
- "What do you have available?"
- "Can you tell me what's in stock?"

**Expected:** AI says "Let me check what we have..." then lists products

#### **Specific Product Search:**
- "Do you have [product name]?"
- "I'm looking for [keyword]"
- "Tell me about your [category]"

**Expected:** AI searches and describes matching products

#### **Pricing & Availability:**
- "How much is [product]?"
- "Is [product] available?"
- "What's the price of [product]?"

**Expected:** AI provides accurate price and stock status

## **Behind the Scenes:**

When you ask about products, this happens:

1. **Customer asks:** "What do you sell?"
2. **AI thinks:** "I should use get_products function"
3. **AI calls:** `POST /api/vapi/functions` with function name
4. **Server fetches:** Real data from Shopify API
5. **Server returns:** Product list to AI
6. **AI responds:** "We have [products]. Let me tell you about them..."

## **Monitoring & Debugging:**

### **Check the Logs:**
When you call and ask about products, you'll see:

```

```

### **Test the Endpoint Directly:**
```bash
# Health check
curl https://localhost:3000/api/vapi/functions

# Should return:
{
  "status": "ok",
  "functions": ["get_products", "search_products"],
